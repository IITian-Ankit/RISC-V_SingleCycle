# Single-Cycle RISC-V Processor

This project is a comprehensive implementation of a single-cycle RISC-V processor designed and simulated using Verilog HDL. It demonstrates the fundamental architecture and working of a simplified RISC-V CPU, focusing on instruction execution in a single clock cycle.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project aims to build a fully functional single-cycle RISC-V processor that supports the RV32I instruction set architecture. The design covers all key components, including:

- Instruction Fetch and Decode  
- Register File  
- ALU with arithmetic and logic operations  
- Control Unit for generating control signals  
- Immediate Generation and Sign Extension  
- Data Memory Access  
- Program Counter Update Logic

The processor executes each instruction in one clock cycle, illustrating the basic principles of RISC-V architecture and hardware design.
